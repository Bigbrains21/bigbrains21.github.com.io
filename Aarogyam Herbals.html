        <h1>Aarogyam Herbals Cigarette</h1>
    
    <p1>A wide range of consumable products may be used as a filling, in lieu of tobacco.
        Corn silk and a number of flavorful herbs, such as mint, cinnamon or lemongrass, have been utilized by a wide
        number of herbal cigarette producers.
        Other manufacturers have included non-herbs like rose petals or clover leaves.
        Some use the flavorless bagasse and make the herbal cigarette depend on the flavoring; this is especially common
        in shisha.
        Some are made with dried lettuce leaves or shredded cabbage leaves.</p1>

    <p2>Research shows that herbal cigarettes compared with regular cigarettes can be just as harmful in terms of the
        carcinogens they contain.
        Dr. John Moore-Gillan, chairman of the British Lung Foundation, states the addictive qualities to herbal
        cigarettes may be taken out, however other harmful elements remain.
        A study on Chinese herbal cigarettes found they had about the same amount of carcinogens as regular cigarettes.
        There are toxic components of the smoke of herbal cigarettes which are similar to regular cigarettes.
        Aminobiphenyl can cause bladder cancer.
        can be fatal in "low concentration of approximately 667 Î¼g/mL."
        CO can cause coronary artery disease as well.
        Short term symptoms of CO include headaches, dizziness, irritability and difficulty breathing.
